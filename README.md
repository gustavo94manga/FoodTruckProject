# FoodTruck Application
Many users often leave reviews for the places they frequent. This application is a small sample of how a customer would leave a review for a mobile restaurant, in other words, a food truck.

# Description
This Food Truck Project is designed to show a unique ID identifier for each Food Truck. The user is not able to manually enter and set an ID, as that would be considered sensitive information. The user gets to interact with this application by entering the name, the type of food it serves, and by giving it an overall rating. Similar to an online review, the user will then get that same information output back to them, again, with the unique ID already assigned to each truck. The user is able to loop through the menu options after the data is entered, and continue choosing to see the different types of information display. 

# Technologies Used
Java, Eclipse

# Lessons Learned
I got more hands on experience working with constructors, static and non-static methods, switch statements, public and private fields, as well as with single dimension arrays. I had to make proper use of for Loops in order to go through the array indexes and get the average ratings, as well as the highest single rating given by the user.
